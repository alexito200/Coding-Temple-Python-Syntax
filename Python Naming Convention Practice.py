# Task 1 Code Correction
# note: the naming conventions are as follows: camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase

pi_value = 3.14 # I will change this variable name into snake case
userAge = 25 # this variable is using camel case so this follows naming conventions
user_location = "New York" # this variable uses the snake case so this follows naming conventions
MAX_LIMIT = 1000 # The two words together are hard to read, I will include an underscore

print(type(MAX_LIMIT))
